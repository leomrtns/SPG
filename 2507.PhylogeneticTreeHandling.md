## Intro
Phylogenetic trees are weighted, usually undirected trees. The terminology comes from evolutionary theory, as in the Tree of Life. The vertices are called branches, and the weights are the branch lengths. These branches are plotted proportional to their lengths ---thus specialised visualisation software is needed. The tips represent the species or strains or biological entities for which we have a sample (i.e. we observe at the present), and the internal nodes represent an unobserved (ancestral, older than the tips) entity. Sometimes these are called the LCA (least common ancestor) or MRCA (most recent common ancestor) of the tips "below" it. Traditionally (i.e. due to limitations in estimation procedures and some dubious biological explanation) these trees are binary.

It is usually undirected since although we know there is some time directionality (tips are the present, internal nodes are the past), we cannot infer the root node, that is the node which is the LCA of all tips. Some methods assume we can infer the root, but importantly probabilistic methods (i.e. those based on the _phylogenetic likelihood_) do not.

A topology is a phylogenetic tree without the branch length information, i.e. the unweighted tree. Sometimes this branching pattern is the only information the researcher is interested in (or, in other words, sometimes we have a hard time interpreting the lengths and we can only claim something regarding the splitting of nodes). Notice that I usually interpret the  trees as a construct, that is, something that we infer and that is very useful, but does not represent some deep truth which can be known or solved (many people say that there is no tree of life because life is a network).

## Storage
The standard for storing phylogenetic trees in files is the *newick format*, which is a text hierarchical parenthetic format One example is `((A,B),(C,D))` to mean `A` and `B` together in one ancestor, which is itself connected to the ancestor between `C` and `D`. Notice that this tree looks rooted, because the deeper split is a bifurcation (two daughter nodes). Which is fine as long as the software reading this tree knows that there is no root node (if that is the case, since some models do need the root information). Therefore it is perfectly fine to store phylogenetic trees in data structures expecting a rooted tree. So that, as usual, nodes have one parent and (exactly) two children. Except for the root node, which does not have a parent and only have two children.

Just to mention that there are two ways of "forcing" the newick format to represent unrooted trees: one is to have the deepest node as a trifurcation, as in`((A,B),C,D)` in the example above. Another way, borrowing from the nexus format (see below) is to add the rootedness as a comment, as in `[U] ((A,B),(C,D))`  for unrooted and  `[R] ((A,B),(C,D))`  for rooted. 

Branch lengths are represented as numbers after a colon in a node. The node can be a tip or an internal node, like `((A:1,B:1):0.1,(C:5,D:0.5):0.1):0.333` (notice that the root node can have a branch length, in this case `0.333`). I believe that the "newick" format relates to both the string representation as well as the file format (which assumes one or more such strings per file).
### Nexus format for storing different trees on same data set
Another common file format, popularised by Bayesian tools like `MrBayes` and `BEAST`, is the _nexus format_. It has several less relevant (and outdated) blocks like "DATA" and "DISTANCES", but it has the `TREE` block that can store a collection of trees sharing the same tips (i.e. taxa):
```
Begin TREES;
  Tree tree1 = ((Alpha,Beta),Gamma,Delta);
  Tree tree2 = ((Alpha,Gamma),Beta,Delta);
END;
```
Or, mapping the tip names:
```
Begin TREES;
Translate
1 Alpha, 
2 Beta,
3 Gamma, 
4 Delta;
  Tree tree1 = ((1,2),3,4); [ comments are within brackets, like this]
  Tree tree2 = ((1,3),2,4);
END;
```
For large trees or long tip names, this translation can save some space. Each one of the trees is a newick string. Branch lengths are accepted as usual. Notice that phylogenetic tree formats must be self-contained thus the file must have the tip names. Usually a Bayesian phylogenetics software will output sample trees as above, in nexus format. The some tool can summarise this posterior distribution, giving you something like
```
#NEXUS

Begin trees;
 Translate
        1  schizosaccharomyces_pombe,
        2  saccharomyces_cerevisiae,
        3  drosophila_melanogaster,
        4  caenorhabditis_elegans,
        5  monosiga_brevicollis,
        6  schistosoma_mansoni,
        7  drosophila_yakuba,
        8  gallus_gallus,
        9  homo_sapiens
;
tree tree_1 [p = 0.6000, P = 0.6000] = [&W 0.60000000] ((((7,3),(2,1)),4),(((9,8),5),6));
tree tree_0 [p = 0.4000, P = 1.0000] = [&W 0.40000000] ((((7,3),4),(2,1)),(((9,8),5),6));

End;
```
where the numbers within brackets are the posterior probabilities, and the file is sorted by them. 
### Storage of repeated topology across samples, but with different branch lengths
In the paper (Penn, M. J., Scheidwasser, N., Khurana, M. P., DuchÃªne, D. A., Donnelly, C. A., & Bhatt, S. (2024). Phylo2Vec: a vector representation for binary trees. _Systematic Biology_. arXiv. https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syae030)  they describe the "Phylo2Vec" integer vector representation of topologies (i.e. without branch lengths). They describe in passing the addition of branch lengths to their represetnation.

## Distance between trees
Usually distance between trees can be calculated when the two leafmaps coincide (i.e. the tip labels are all the same). If there are tip labels missing from one of the trees, then its node is removed from the non-missing tree. 
## Resampling
NNI, SPR distances

### Resampling incorporating proximity in non-Euclidean spaces
